### Thanks for interesting about this project.
Please dont forget to leave a star ))
[Ease to use map-reminder shopping list](https://github.com/Timka2014/grocery-list). 
The goal of this application is to act as a checklist of groceries that need to be purchased including the grocery item names. 
To begin, we'll want to modify our App component to display a form that allows us to add a new grocery item and be able to 
delete the items which already on our list.
